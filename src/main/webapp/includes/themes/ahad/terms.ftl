<h2>AHAD User Agreement and Policy Statements</h2>

<h3>Preamble</h3>
<p>The Australian Historical Archaeological Database (‘<i>AHAD</i>’) provides the platform to share unpublished catalogues, datasets, documents, manuscripts, images and published works (‘<i>resources</i>’), or parts thereof, for the purposes of conducting research, and creating new archaeological knowledge.

<p>The majority of AHAD resources represent years of research by numerous archaeologists, historians and other specialists, and some describe material culture of high significance to some communities.  Depositors are expected to make every effort to identify the creators and copyright holders of these works, and other parties with vested interest in the resources, prior to publication.</p>

<h3>Take-down policy</h3>

<li>The Rights Holder will be contacted, wherever possible.</li>
<li>The matter will be referred to the Editorial Board who will recommend whether the Resource be reinstated (with or without redaction)</li>
</ul></p>
<h3>Editorial Policy</h3>
<p>Records created by Depositors are considered to be their own work and their own responsibility and depositors are best placed to describe their own work. However, some elements of the record, particularly the creation or selection or keywords require reference to similar resources described by other depositors. AHAD editors share the responsibility to maintain consistency in these terms wherever possible.
Individual records may be edited by the User who created the record, and any other User to whom they granted Access Rights. Only the individual who created the record can delete it.
The AHAD Site Administrator and AHAD Editor has/have the technical ability to access any individual record (in Draft and Active status), but will only do so in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>if requested by the User who created the record, or a User with Access Rights, in order to provide technical assistance;</li>
<li>to embargo a Resource or Record suspected of breeching the Conditions of Use;</li>
<li>to delete a Resource or Record found to be in breech of the Conditions of Use, or reinstate one found to be compliant.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, AHAD reserves the right to edit keywords to make them consistent with usage in the majority of records.  In the event that this is necessary: </p>
<ul>
<li>changes will only be made to keywords with unequivocal synonyms or variations in spelling; and</li>
<li>the user will be notified of the changes. </li>
</ul>
<p>If more complex changes are required, e.g. to Site Name keywords, the AHAD editor will liaise with the User prior to making changes.</p>
